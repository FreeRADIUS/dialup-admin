No, there isn't. It's easier for me to write code than to document it :-)
Anyway, I always try to make better documentation.
There's also this FAQ :-)

> What tables do I need to create in the MySQL database?

It depends.
If you are using ldap for user authentication/information then you only need
to create the freeradius sql tables (in order to create the radacct table,
the other tables will just sit around doing nothing) which can be created from a
sql script in the freeradius distribution. If you are runing mysql it is in
src/modules/rlm_sql/drivers/rlm_sql_mysql/db_mysql.sql

If you are using mysql for user authentication/information then you will again
need to create the freeradius sql tables and if you want you could also create
the userinfo table to store user information (name,telephone etc)

You could also create the badusers table if you want the functionality it provides.

sql scripts to create the badusers and userinfo tables can be found in the
directory sql (of dialup_admin distribution).

First of all check conf/user_edit.atts and see if the attribute you are interested in is
commented out. If it is just enable it by uncommenting it. If the attribute is not
included in the file add it. If you use SQL check conf/sql.attrmap. If you use LDAP check
${freeradius_install_dir}/etc/raddb/ldap.attrmap and check if the attribute is included in
the attribute mapping. If it is not then add it there also.
Everything should work ok after that.
