* Minimize database (ldap,mysql) connections.
* Clean up html code to make it smaller
* More messages
* Skins
* Other languages in html
* Multilanguage support for ldap attributes
* Add language attributes in user_new.php3
* Finger facility. Should find a way to make it work with all nases. That will
  mean that it should be made modular and fall back to simple queries to the
  sql db if it cannot get user info from the nas server
* Check out dbx library. It seems very promising for database independent code.
  We 'll see where it goes.
