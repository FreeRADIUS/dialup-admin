dialup_admin is a web based administration interface for the freeradius radius server.
It is modular and right now it assumes that user information is stored in an ldap server
or an sql database and accounting in an sql server.

There are also a few more things included:

* sql/badusers.sql: It will create a table named badusers which can be used to hold the
  history for badusers (date,action)
* sql/userinfo.sql: It will create a table named userinfo which contains personal information
  for users stored in the sql database. This can be used if a sql database is used to store user profiles
  (not ldap).
* bin/log_badlogins: It will constantly check the radiusd.log file and add all login-incorrect,
  invalid-user, outside of allowed login time  and multiple-login cases to the radacct table with
  acctstarttime=acctstoptime, acctsessiontime=0 and acctterminatecause containing the reason.
  If the failing module sent back a module message then it will also appear in the terminate cause.
  You will need to setup the $mysql and $tmpfile variables to suite your mysql installation and needs.
  Perl module Date::Manip is needed by the script.
* bin/clean_radacct: It will delete all entries in the radacct table with a starttime > 1 day and
  stoptime = 0. It will not do an harm even if it deletes valid entries since radiusd will fall
  back to insert if update fails.

The structure of the tree is:

conf:: Contains various configuration files.
conf::admin.conf=>
	The main configuration file. The directives used should be easily
	understood
conf::config.php3=>
	Just a helper php4 for reading the admin.conf file. Just make sure that it
	opens the correct admin.conf file
conf::default.vals=>
	Contains the default values for check and reply items. If you also use the users
	file except for the ldap/sql databases fill in the default values you have inserted
	for the users.Else comment them out.
conf::sql.attrs=>
	Contains inmformation about the sql attributes. This is used by the accounting
	report generator (accounting.php3).
conf::user_edit.attrs=>
	Contains the attributes that user_edit.php3 will show. Just uncomment those
	which you want to be displayed.
conf::extra.ldap-attrmap=>
	Contains a few items not included in ldap.attrmap which are used only by dialup_admin
	Things like User-Password and Dialup-Lock-Msg. Use none for attributes that are not known
	by the radius or ldap server.
conf::sql.attrmap=>
	Contains the Attribute map for the sql database. Use none for attributes that are not known by
	the radius server.
conf::auth.request=>
	Contains value pairs sent in the test packets which are sent from the test user/server pages.

htdocs:: Contains the basic php files
htdocs::index.html=>

htdocs::buttons.html=>
	The buttons html page
htdocs::style.css=>

	weekly used,weekly connections,daily used,daily connections
