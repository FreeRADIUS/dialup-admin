* Minimize database (ldap,mysql) connections.
* Clean up html code to make it smaller
* More messages
* Multilanguage support for ldap attributes
* Add language attributes in user_new.php
* Finger facility. Should find a way to make it work with all nases. That will
  mean that it should be made modular and fall back to simple queries to the
  sql db if it cannot get user info from the nas server
* Check out dbx library. It seems very promising for database independent code.
  We 'll see where it goes.
* Add billing and statistics pages. Billing is a must. The page should also create
  reports which could be printed or sent by email to the users containing their billing
  information. We also need more statistics pages with fancy bars and diagrams. Ideas
  are welcome.
* Parse the radius dictionary files so that we can show a pull down menu of possible values
  for various attributes.
* Also be able to keep username mappings in sql. Create an administration page
* Improve sqlrelay support
* Make the userinfo attributes configurable and create calculation formulas.Like:
  Attribute-Name:DB-Attribute:Internal-Attribute:Initial-Value:Editable
  Administrator:admin:admin:%U:No
