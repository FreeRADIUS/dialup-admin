Ver 1.30:
* Add limit of results returned in accounting.php3
* Fix a bug in time2strclock() in lib/functions.php3. Seconds ammount more than 9 would not show.
  Bug noted by Timophey <bcloud@mail.ru>
* Reaarange a few things in user_admin. Put Subscription Analysis first and 'Account Status' second. Make a
  few things bold.
* Change log_badlogins to use the mysql binary instead of the DBI module. That way we don't have any
  dependencies and we don't need to bother with connection maintainance (dead mysql connections etc).
* html fixes in user_finger.php3
* Fix a bug in lib/add_badusers.php3 which did not allow inserts in the badusers table.
* Make lib/ldap/password_check.php3 behave properly when it is passed a null password

  radaclient).
* Add general_finger_type directive to determine if we will use snmpfinger in user_finger.php3
* Fix a bug in config.php3 when we have a directive containing ':'
* Fix a bug in lib/ldap/change_attrs.php3 that did not allow changing more than one value of a 
  multivalued attribute simultaneously.
* Added selection of ordering in user_accounting.php3. Now it can be either ascending (older records
  first) or descending (most recent records first). Added a corresponding configuration directive.
* Added operator support in sql. The eq(=),set(:=) and add(+=) operators are supported. Added an
  sql_use_operators configuration directive. Hope everything works.
* Fixed a bug in sql/change_attrs which did not allow multi valued attributes in sql.
* unset item_vals before adding info in ldap and sql user_info files.
* Add support for the rest of the operators. Created the lib/operators.php3 file containing helper functions
* Fix a small bug in log_badlogins. The nas domain should be a variable not hard coded.

Ver 1.28:
* Make user_delete.php3 print something when a user is deleted
* Cache nas hostname lookups in user_accounting

* Deleted a mysql_close from lib/mysql/create_user since we now have persistent sql connections

* A lot of html changes in accounting.php3
* Changed the sql code to be modular. Now under lib we don't have a mysql directory but a sql directory
  with a directory drivers which contains the database specific functions. As a result all calls to mysql*
  functions where changed to call da_sql* functions. Right now mysql should work and postgresql *may* work
  It is not tested though. Hopefully things will come back to being stable in a few days.
* Added sql_port and sql_type configuration file directives
Ver 1.20:
